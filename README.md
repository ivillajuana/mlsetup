# mlsetup (my linux setup)
Original, I know. By now, this repository only contains:

- Configuration files:
  - bash (shell)
  - mpd/ncmpcpp (music client) 
  - mpv (video)
  - nvim (cli editor; includes ftplugins for HTML, LaTeX & more)
- Goals:
  - Automate software installation
  - Add specific files for system / microserver installation(s) 
  - Add more configurations
